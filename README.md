**Executive Summary**
The Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District (shortened to Mat-Su) is located approximately 35 miles north of Anchorage in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, spanning approximately 25,000 square miles, an area larger than the entire state of West Virginia. This large area also represents a large body of students, with district-wide enrollment of just over 19,000 students, making it the second largest school District in Alaska.

Given the size and scope of the school district, our client, AHFC, installed an application called BMON into most schools. BMON monitors each school's gas and electricity consumption every 15 minutes. 

Using this rich dataset, we were able to analyze consumptions patterns of the schools and identify inefficiencies. 


We developed the unoccupied-to-occupied ratio, a ratio found by dividing a schoolâ€™s non-school hours electricity consumption by school hours consumption. We hoped this ratio would answer: how is my school building consuming electricity after school hours compared to school hours, and how do my usage patterns compare to other schools?
