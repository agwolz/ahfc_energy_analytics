Part of a team of five Delta Analytics Fellows working with the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation to reduce the energy consumption across their stock of schools. 

**Executive Summary**<br>
The Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District (shortened to Mat-Su) is large school district in Alaska, covering an area larger than the entire state of West Virginia. This large area also represents a large body of students; it's the second largest school District in Alaska.

Energy and electricity are important in Alaska. Much of the year is cold and dark, and the high cost of electricity means it represents a large part of school budgets.

Using energy consumption data from schools across the district, I was able to analyze consumptions patterns of the schools and identify inefficiencies. Our **goal** was to uncover inefficient usage patterns and provide a succinct, actionable metric for school administrators to understand their school's performance.

**Result**<br>
After uncovering large disparities in school vs non-school hour electricity consumption across the school district, I developed the unoccupied-to-occupied ratio; a measure of how much electricity a school consumed during non-schools hours vs school hours. I specifically created this metric since it accomplished several key requirements that I decided with our AHFC stakeholders:
* Scalable and Comparable - used in all schools, and simple methodology means comparison across schools is simple
* Intuitive - The higher the ratio, the larger the opportunity for energy savings
* Actionable - More energy consumption during non-school hours is a 'low-hanging fruit' for reducing environmental impact and energy costs
